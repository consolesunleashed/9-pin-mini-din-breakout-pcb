# 9-Pin Mini DIN Breakout PCB

A simple 9-Pin Mini DIN breakout PCB for AV modding consoles. Uses standard Sega Mega Drive 2 signal routing. Features a jumper to combine left and right audio channels, and a jumper to send the left audio channel, or both, to the mono audio pin. It's about as good as a 9-Pin Mini DIN breakout PCB could be.
